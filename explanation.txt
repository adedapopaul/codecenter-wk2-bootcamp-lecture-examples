strings methods are functions you can call on a string.

stg i s a sting in our example here


length method gives me the length of my string

stg.length 
stg.toUpperCase()   --- this turns my string to capital lethher

indexOf() methods gives me the index of a word in a string

lastIndexOf()

How do you declare a date?

 Scope & this

'this' is an object or scope binder.
this binds a property to his owner


var person = {
	firstName : 'Segun',
	lastName: 'Bolaji'
	fullName: function(){
		return this.firstName + this.lastName
	}
}


fullNmae is a function inside the object person.   this makes fullName a method.

To bind the fullNmae as a method to the properties of person.... this comes into play

Return is a keyword. It returns what you defin when you call a function.

Here this binds the properties (firstName & lastName ) to the object Person. This is owned by object Person


Other things to have in mind.

there are global and local scope
let me explainwhat global and local scope means first.



global scope or variable so to speak, is a scope or variable to is accessible form anywhere within your code


local is only accessible within a function or block of code.





lets see an example of local scope.


in the function My Function that we have declared.

number and count is a local variable  because you can only use the variable inside the function myFunction.


here count and number are global variable because we defined them outside of the myFunction block. This makes any function to be able to use the variables count and number.



Variables.... How do you declare variables?

ther are 3 basic ways to declare variables in JS

var --- is use for a changing variable
let 
const ---- const can not be changes once you declare it. you can only use it for a variable you are sure wont change. if you try to change a const variable it will throw an error.



What is RegEx?

it means regular expression. It is used in search pattern. You use regular expression for a search you are not sure of the content or how it is going to look like.

Lets say i want to search a 50 pahe document for my name and number. and im not sure how my name is going to appear in it. 

It could ba all capital letter, all small letter, or inbetween.



you start a regex declaration with a  forward slash----    /dapo\saderemi\s\d+ /i

the above regex finds my name (dapo aderemi) followed by a space and numbers which must be more than one digit. the modifier i tells the pattern to be case insensitive.


if i use test() method on a regular expression, it returns true or false. if the pattern exist, it return true, else it rturn false.



if i use exec() method on a regular expression pattern, it return null if it cant find it and it returns object if it can find it.



GIT??????

Git is a version control system you use to manage your code.

Git works with local and remote repository. You local repository is always on your system while the remote repository can be your Github or BitBucket.


You basically push your code from your local repository to remote repository from git.


How do you use Git
1. You have to have Java JDK installed on your system
You have to have Node JS installed on your system
You have to have Git installed on your PC


If you ave all these, you now need to create an account on Github.


if yes, you are cool to go....


How do you initiate git in your code or project directory???


You use 'git init'

lets say i have opened my project folder. i now want to initiate git inside my folder


git init -------means initiate git inside this folder


after i have initiated git, it will automatically create a branch called master.  This branch is in my local repository which is on my PC.


I need to start add files or folder to my repository.


you use 'git add'
